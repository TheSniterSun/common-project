Art of Engineering (AOE): Common Project

Created a physical version of the Nintendo game "Keep Talking and No One Explodes." In this 2-person game, the "defuser" interacts with the bomb, while the "overseer" provides instructions via a manual. We designed and implemented 3 modules:

1. Simon Says (3 LEDs flash and a certain button must be pressed)
2. Morse Code (1 LED flashes in morse code and a certain button must be pressed)
3. Equations (An equation is shown on the LCD screen and a certain button must be pressed)
